# Pacman

A Pacman game written in Java with building and testing performed using Gradle.
The character, named Waka, moves within a map inhabited by Ghosts 
(Ambusher, Chaser, Ignorant and Whim) whom have special movement behaviour. Waka
has three lives, and wins by collecting all the fruit on the map.
Waka can collect a superfruit which allows it to capture ghosts for a 
short period of time. It may also collect a soda can object that turns the 
ghosts invisible.

A comprehensive testing suite quantified by high Jacoco coverage and Javadoc is accessible.
Object oriented programming (OOP) principles have been applied, and can be observed in the UML
