A series of automatic testcases can be executed with the following:
make tests
make run_tests

Each .c file in personal_tests will be linked and compiled with the "libbtreestore"
static library. The individual gcov output files will be redirected to 
personal_tests/coverage 

.out files are used to compare the tree structure using export_print(), a function
that uses btree_export() to print all nodes in a DFS pre-order traversal. For tests 
that don't directly call export_print() the .out files will be empty.

(Alphanumeric Order)
// DECRYPT_STANDARD
A standard test of searching for and decrypting the data of a node after a series 
of inserts and deletions. Decrypted data is compared to the original plaintext

// DELETE_STANDARD
A standard composite test of many inserts and deletions

// DELETE_TO_EMPTY
Testing that it is possible to insert, then remove all inserted nodes for the tree 
to revert back to an empty root with no keys.

// INSERT_STANDARD
A standard test of the correctness of a series of inserts

// INVALID_INPUTS
Test that invalid inputs, such as insertion when a key already exists, or NULL,
is handled properly without unexpected changes to the tree structure

// LARGE_CORRECTNESS
Testing that the tree structure remains valid across a large number of insert
and removal operations

// RETRIEVE_STANDARD
A standard test of node retreival, comparing the returned data with the original

// TEA_CTR_ENCRYPTION
Testing the tea_ctr functions for encryption and decryption of arbitrary data

// TEA_ENCRYPTION
Testing the tea functions for encryption and decryption of fixed data
